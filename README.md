Skills

When making a Skill Roll, you must beat a difficulty value set by the GM, if you do not the skill fails. If you surpass the difficulty value you may gain additional beneficial effects, in combat add the additional successes to your damage.

If a character does not have a skill they may only attempt to make a roll if they spend Luck.

Only one point of Luck may be spent at once.

Crits

If you spend luck during a roll things have the opportunity to go either very well or very poorly, if you roll the same number on each d10 when spending luck one of two things may happen. If you succeed on the roll you have performed astonishingly well (in combat add 5 damage on top of the success threshold bonus). On a failure something has gone terribly terribly wrong.

Luck may also prevent a character from dying, if you are about to die your luck value may be permanently reduced by 1 to prevent this death. Once a character has 0 luck left they may not do this.

Endurance:

If an attack deals damage above your Endurance Defence Roll you are Dying, if it does less your Endurance is instead reduced by 1 until you are healed by a medic.

Dodge:

When attacked you may make a Dodge Roll vs the value of their attack roll, on a success you are not hit and you ignore the attack, on a failure you are hit. You may not roll Dodge against attacks you cannot see coming.

You may only either Dodge OR Endure, Not Both

Medic:

If a character is dying you must roll against the damage value that made the character dying in order to stabilise them, they then recover up to an Endurance value equal to your Medic Skill + relevant specialisation. If a character is wounded (has a reduced endurance value) you must roll vs their current endurance value, they recover up to an endurance value equal to your Medic skill + relevant specialisation.

Stunned Characters may not perform an action on their turn, though they may attempt to become unstunned. The difficulty of the Endurance check is equal to the amount of Stun damage dealt. If the character succeeds they may act as normal from the next turn, if they fail, the value of the Stun damage is reduced by one and may reattempt the roll next turn. If the Stun damage reaches 0 the character may act as normal from their next turn.

Unconscious, if a character takes damage that is 5 above their defence roll then the character is knocked unconscious in addition to other damage affects. An unconscious character may take no actions nor move.

Dying characters have 5 rounds before they die, they may take no actions whilst dying though they may move at quarter speed and still speak. If they take damage again the amount of rounds they have left is instead reduced by one (or 3 on a crit).

Physician:

When a character is stunned a physician may attempt to clear the stun effect, they roll their Physician skill vs the current Stun value of the Stunned character, if they succeed the character is no longer stunned and may act as normal at the start of their turn.

Combat:

1 - Attacker rolls (Firearms/Melee) to hit vs DC 5 + modifiers (Range, Weather conditions, Target size) if successful hit, otherwise miss. Excess vs hit adds to damage

2 - If target can see the attack can make a Dodge roll vs the final to-hit roll, if they succeed they manage to get out of the way otherwise they are hit. If they cannot see they cannot make the roll. (on a crit may make a free half move or take cover)

3 - If hit the target rolls Weapon damage + Hit modifier to generate a damage call.

4 - The target rolls D10 + Endurance to determine what damage they take (either dying or wounded)

Equipment:

Range - Guns grant their bonus up to their effective range, after which you may only use your skill plus other relevant bonuses, you cannot hit a target at more than a gun’s maximum range.

INEVITABLE: Ignores bonuses to Dodge Granted by equipment.

STUN: When beating a character&#039;s defence it Stuns the character instead of taking them to Dying. A Crit also makes the character Unconscious regardless if it deals more than 5 damage above their current defence..

TOXIN: The target takes the damage value again in the next round. On a crit they take the damage again on the subsequent round.

Skills:

There exists a skill List - Identical to SIN Skill ListSocial Skills are instead tied to the topic of discussion, for instance convincing someone that their security is compromised would require a Security Systems roll as opposed to a “Deception” roll. Characters may also use StreetDeal/CorpDeal/Matrix Lore as skills to interact with people that belong to each of these types making them effectively Social Skills.
