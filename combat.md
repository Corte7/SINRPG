# Combat:

1 - Attacker rolls (Firearms/Melee) to hit vs DC 5 + modifiers (Range, Weather conditions, Target size) if successful hit, otherwise miss. Excess vs hit adds to damage

2 - If target can see the attack can make a Dodge roll vs the final to-hit roll, if they succeed they manage to get out of the way otherwise they are hit. If they cannot see they cannot make the roll. (on a crit may make a free half move or take cover)

3 - If hit the target rolls Weapon damage + Hit modifier to generate a damage call.

4 - The target rolls D10 + Endurance to determine what damage they take (either dying or wounded)

## Conditions

BURN: Reduces Endurance by 2 (instead of 1) if the attack does not reduce the character to Dying. On a crit reduces their Endurance by 5 instead.

THROUGH: Ignores bonuses to Endurance granted by equipment.

INEVITABLE: Ignores bonuses to Dodge Granted by equipment.

STUN: When beating a character&#039;s defence it Stuns the character instead of taking them to Dying. A Crit also makes the character Unconscious regardless if it deals more than 5 damage above their current defence..

TOXIN: The target takes the damage value again in the next round. On a crit they take the damage again on the subsequent round.
